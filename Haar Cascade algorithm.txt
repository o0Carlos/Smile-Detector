In a simple explanation, Haar (from its inventor) Cascade works as a casade.

From an initial image, it starts "reducing" the image until it finds out an square
that look like a face as a loop.


The way it finds faces is becuase of the

Haar Features:

 - Edge Features
 - Line Features
 - Four-rectangle features

This three features are used in an image to look out for a face.

This algorithm doesn't actually look for a "face", this algorithm search for how darker or
lighter an image is in certain Ã¡reas. So actually we only need grayscale. (search in
google "haar features" to understand it better and see the actual features).

Now, how does machine learning its aplied?

Well, first of all we start training the Data with some positive image (faces) and some
negative images (non faces). This is called "supervised machine learning".

So the algorithm will aply the Edge Features at some points of the image and after finding
the vectors where there is an edge features, it will apply the next feature. As a cascade.

It will use an scoring system (corresponding to the times a feature can be applied to an
image), until it finds a score of 1000 (for example) then it will say that it is a face.

So yeah. Another simple explanation:

In a loop, the algorithm will apply the Haar Features at every area of the image until
it finds a face.
